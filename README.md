After studying the current e-commerce applications, I found that they have some issues that we want to solve and offer in our web application, such as:
- Offer a list of products that have a national prize.
- Protecting user data from loss or theft.
- Access to the grocery store data from anywhere at any time from any device.
- provide a full statistical report for the store owner.
- offline mode for the application to work without an internet connection.
- a mobile application for the store owner to manage the store.
